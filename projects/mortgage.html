              <p1>Using the ONS HPI dataset, I assembled the following mortgage plan for an average UK first-time buyer in 1997.</p1>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p1>I decided to choose 1997 as the starting year of the mortgage because of the wide range of data available from 1997 to 2022 which proved to be helpful in estimating missing data later on.</p1>

              <p1>Given that interest rates on mortgages are variable, it can be difficult to predict the monthly cost of a mortgage. By using the average interest rates on mortgages for each year, the yearly cost of this mortgage plan can be calculated. I will be using the Bank of England's data on various LTV and the average mortgage rate data from an ONS dataset in order to achieve this </p1>

              <p1>Both the Bank of England and the ONS HPI datasets were missing data for some of the years that the mortgage plan covered. The Bank of England's LTV data on 10% deposits only covered the range from 2008 to 2023. Furthermore, the only consistent data from this dataset was the 2 year fixed interest rate as the 5 year fixed interest rate data had a lot of gaps. The ONS average mortgage rates covered the range from 2004 to 2022 whereas I needed data on variable mortgage rates from at least the year 2000.</p1>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p1>However, I did manage to find other economic data for the UK during this time period that could be used to help estimate the missing interest rates data.</p1>

              <p1>I split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. The training data had 128 examples from 4 features, creating a matrix of (128, 4) to be fed into the network. The testing data was made up of 36 examples which I picked from different years as some years had very different economic conditions compared to others. The model architecture consisted of 4 layers with 4, 6, 10 and 14 neurons in the layers respectively.</p1>

              <p1>I chose to create a payment plan for a capital repayment mortgage as this tends to be more common compared to an interest only mortgage.

              <p1>Assuming the appropriate checks are carried out, the bank can agree a contract with the buyer in which they both collectively buy the house. The buyer would place a deposit on the house and the bank would own the rest of house. The buyer can then buy back the bank's equity in the house through deferred payments over the term of the contract.</p1>

              <br>

              <p1>As long as the bank holds equity in the house, the buyer has to pay the bank rent and monthly contribution costs set by the bank. At the end of the contract, the buyer should have bought the bank's entire equity in the house and so the buyer becomes the sole owner of the house.</p1>

              <p1>The main reason why this method of purchasing a house should be used is to reduce the burden on the house buyer in the event of an unexpected default. Since the buyer's payments were contributing to ownership of the house as opposed to paying contributions on a loan, in the event of default, it is clear that the buyer is entitiled to the portion of a potential house sale that reflects their equity.</p1>
              <br/>
              <br/>

              <p1>The key disadvantage with this method is that because the bank is buying the house, there is higher exposure to the risk of the house depreciating. In the worst case scenario, the buyer may unexpectedly default very early on in the contract and the housing market crashes simultaneously. This means the bank would not have received a lot of money through the buyer's monthly payments and the current market conditions would make it very difficult for the to recover their loss even by selling the entire asset.</p1>

              <p1>The amortization technique can help reduce the risk for banks. It can replicate a payment structure similar to that of a capital repayment mortgage.</p1>
              <br/>
              <br/>

              <p1>Every month, the buyer will pay rent and equity contribution to the bank. Armortization can ensure that the bank keep more equity in the early time period within the contract. This is because initially, each monthly payment will consist of a very small contribution to buying the bank's equity and will mostly consist of paying rent to the bank. If the buyer were to default at this stage, the bank would have kept a large amount of equity in the house and so they will be entitled to keep more money from the sale of the house. If the buyer does default, the buyer will no longer pay equity contributions as part of their monthly payments and will continue paying rent until the bank sells the house.</p1>

              <br>
              <br>
              <p1>The image shows the reduction in the bank's equity across the 25 years (300 months) of the purchase plan.</p1>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p1>In addition to using amortization to determine the monthly rent, if the bank could forecast the volatility of an area's house prices, it can also help decide how to set rent to minimize risk in case the area's housing market may crash.</p1>

              <h5 class="model" style="color: var(--main);">Features:</h5>

              <ul>
                <li>Change in average UK house prices (%)</li>
                <li>Quarterly GDP change</li>
                <li>Unemployment rate</li>
                <li>Inflation (RPI)</li>
                <li>2 years fixed interest rate on 75% LTV</li>
                <li>Average UK income</li>
              </ul>
              <br>

              <p1>The training set had a shape of (92, 6) and the testing set contained 20 examples. 3 layers were used with 6, 14 and 26 neurons respectively.</p1>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p1>The model predicted the average house prices in South West England to change by <b>-3.69%</b> when the following values for 2023 Q1 were inputted. This model can give the bank an insight into whether house prices in a given region may drop or appreciate. This can allow the bank to plan ahead and decide what rent rate should be set knowing the house prices are going to change.</p1>  
              <br>
              <br>
              <p1>Introducing area-specific data to the model can improve its performance. It currently analyzes UK economic data but if there were data for the region alone or maybe specific areas in the region, the model can make more accurate predictions. Regional data on the population, income and the number of houses are some examples that can improve the model becuase these variables influence the region's house prices.</p1>
