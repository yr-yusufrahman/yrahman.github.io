              <p1>Using the ONS HPI dataset, I assembled the following mortgage plan for an average UK first-time buyer in 1997.</p1>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p1>I decided to choose 1997 as the starting year of the mortgage because of the wide range of data available from 1997 to 2022 which proved to be helpful in estimating missing data later on.</p1>
              <br/>
              <br>
              <p1>Given that interest rates on mortgages are variable, it can be difficult to predict the monthly cost of a mortgage. By using the average interest rates on mortgages for each year, the yearly cost of this mortgage plan can be calculated. I will be using the Bank of England's data on various LTV and the average mortgage rate data from an ONS dataset in order to achieve this </p1>
              <br/>
              <p1>Data had to be cleaned.</p1>

              <br/>
              <p1>However, I did manage to find other economic data for the UK during this time period and so this data could be used to help estimate the missing LTV data and missing average mortgage rate data.</p1>
